# BTGraphs
Incoming data graph from bluetooth, final project of computers architecture.  

## How works
BTGraphs lets choice you a paired bluetooth device then
it catch all incoming data of selected device and graph it into
a line chart...

## Whats the objective of the project?  
BTGraphs catch sent data from a bluetooth socket into a PIC16F877A,
that incoming data represents the temperature that is gotten by a 
temperature sensor.
